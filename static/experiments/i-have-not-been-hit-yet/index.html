	I am still probably going to cry.
	I lie on my bed,

	                 waiting for the tears to come out.

	I wish I had the time to sing before that happens.
	       I wish I had the time to paint before that happens

	                                      all of the tiny small things that made me smile
	in the middle of the unlit hole that is my immeasurable shame.
