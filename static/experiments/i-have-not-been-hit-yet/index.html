		<h1>I have not been hit yet.</h1>

		<p>I am still probably going to cry.<br />
		I lie on my bed,</p>

		<p>waiting for the tears to come out.</p>

		<p>I wish I had the time to sing before that happens.<br/>
		I wish I had the time to paint before that happens</p>

		<p>all of the tiny small things that made me smile<br/>
		in the middle of the unlit hole that is my immeasurable shame.</p>
