<!-- more -->

in the past, whenever one \
would want to be able to do \
*something <ruby><s>more</s><rp>(</rp><rt>new</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>* with their \
machine, they would have to \
get the software to do it.

now, with all of the pre-installed \
/featureful software that there \
is, they either have to <ruby><s>dig</s> <rp>(</rp><rt>seek</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> in<s>to</s> <ruby><s>what</s> <rp>(</rp><rt>that which</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> \
they already have or, more likely, \
<s>don't want to do anything new \
because of their overwhelmedness</s> \
<u>are too whelmed to even \
want to do something new</u>.

software went from an additive model to a substractive one:

  „get what you want“ \
  got replaced by \
  „get rid of what you don't want“.

this is noticeable through all \
of the O.S. unbloaters and the \
minimalistic alternatives to \
mainstream solutions.
