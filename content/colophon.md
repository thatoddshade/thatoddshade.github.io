## most importantly

no, not love.

hatred.

burning and flaming hatred.

hatred towards those eyes which dare see one as something which they are not, a being of of a steady mind.

hatred towards those mouthes which restlessly entertain themselves with their sarcastical blathering.

â€¦

and also some computer time.
