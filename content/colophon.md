## essentially

to edit configuration files and write posts, I use neovim.

posts are written in [Markdown](https://commonmark.org). \
styling is written in [Sass](https://sass-lang.com).

generating is done with [Zola](https://www.getzola.org).

## additionally

to interact with git, I use the lazygit TUI. \
for terminal multiplexing, I use zellij.
