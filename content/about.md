## The website {#website}

Back in 2023, among crumbling personal projects in the messiness of forgotten directories, this website first rose as a purple page of candid creativity. [Its colours were untasteful, its CSS was awful…](https://web.archive.org/web/20230110095501/https://thatoddshade.github.io/)

But it eventually morphed into a more delicate piece, which, although still novice, had a keen [use of blur and transparency](https://web.archive.org/web/20230326153840/https://thatoddshade.github.io/en/).

Then, after all that violet, came an illuminated era of beige in which it still re&shy;mains to this day,—just as it al&shy;ways has been available on a public [GitHub repository](https://github.com/thatoddshade/thatoddshade.github.io/) and has been made with (roughly) the same tools (check out the [Colophon](/colophon)!).

Born and raised in Europe, my mother tongue is not English; but an over-consumption of online con&shy;tent has made me fluent in the written language.

I often draw,—I have always had crayons, pencils, markers, paint, pens and other tools;—this picture on the right is a small pastel and watercolour de&shy;piction of an <abbr title="original character">O.C.</abbr> of mine.

2020 was the first time I have ever done pro&shy;gram&shy;ming : during the lockdown, my time on the com&shy;pu&shy;ter vastly increased and I stumbled upon a free, basic HTML course of a few videos that allowed me to get into the world of *computer science*. 

Most of my coding today happens either on this website or on some game pro&shy;ject in [Godot](https://godotengine.org).

Another interest of mine is linguistics : this comes from back when I started lear&shy;n&shy;ing Latin in school. Because of that, I also have extensively explored <abbr title="language constructing">conlanging</abbr>[^cl].

The researches that I have done have led me to write and increasing number of notes. Because of this, I use more than one notebook,—a sketchbook, a diary, a bul&shy;let journal, an address book etc.,—and store in a small crate on my desk the pre&shy;mice of a zettelkasten[^zk].

[^cl]: <dfn><abbr title="Constructed languages">Conlangs</abbr></dfn> are languages created by people known as ‘conlangers’. Some of the most popular conlangs are Zamenhof’s famous language Esperanto, which aims to serve as a universal medium of communication; Lojban, a community-made language whose goal is to be as logical as possible; and [Toki Pona](https://tokipona.org/), a recently tren&shy;dy one that is meant to be small and minimalist in order to not only be easy to learn, but also to force upon its speakers a more thoughtful use of words.

[^zk]: <dfn><i lang="de">Zettelkasten</i></dfn>,—German compound of <i lang="de">Zettel</i> ‘note’ and <i lang="de">Kasten</i> ‘box’, with the plu&shy;ral form <i lang="de">Zettelkästen</i>,—refers to a personal knowledge management method po&shy;pu&shy;larised by sociologist Niklas Luhmann during the 20th century; many re&shy;sour&shy;ces by dedicated users may be found on the [Zettelkasten website](https://zettelkasten.de/).
