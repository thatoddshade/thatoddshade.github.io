## this website

it originally started with [an untastefully purple page with an unhealthy amount of external content and tons of awful CSS](https://web.archive.org/web/20230110095501/https://thatoddshade.github.io/); later, it became [a somewhat more decent one with epic blur effects](https://web.archive.org/web/20230326153840/https://thatoddshade.github.io/en/) (those are in at least one of every front-end developer's phases.); what can currently be seen at <thatoddshade.github.io> and, since literally today, <thatoddshade.is-a.dev> is built with [Zola](https://www.getzola.org) from [Markdown](https://commonmarl.org), [Sass](https://sass-lang.com) and some HTML.
