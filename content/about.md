## this website {#website}

it originally started with [an untastefully purple page with an unhealthy amount of external content and tons of awful CSS](https://web.archive.org/web/20230110095501/https://thatoddshade.github.io/); \
later, it became [a somewhat more decent one with epic blur effects](https://web.archive.org/web/20230326153840/https://thatoddshade.github.io/en/) (those are in at least one of every front-end developer's phases.); \

the way in which it is currently made can be seen at [the „colophon“ page](/colophon).

it is and always has been stored in [a publicly available GitHub repository](https://github.com/thatoddshade/thatoddshade.github.io).

## me

I:
- often draw.
- conlang[^conlang].
- have more than one web identity; *thatoddshade*:
    - is the one I use on [this website](#website) and other places.
    - is the main one.
- occasionally work on a video game with [the Godot game engine](https://godotengine.org).
- have a *Zettelkasten*[^zettelkasten].

[^conlang]: „conlang“ is both a noun that means „constructed language“ and a verb that means „construct a language/languages“; a famous conlang is Esperanto; my favourite one is [toki pona](https://tokipona.org).

[^zettelkasten]: „Zettelkasten“ (a German compound from „Zettel“, which means „note“, and „Kasten“, which means „box“, of which the plural is „Zettelkästen“) refers to a personal knowledge management method popularised by Niklas Luhmann; more about it can be learnt from [the Zettelkasten website](https://zettelkasten.de).
