## this website {#website}

0. it originally started with [an untastefully purple page with an unhealthy amount of external content and tons of awful CSS](https://web.archive.org/web/20230110095501/https://thatoddshade.github.io/);
1. later, it became [a somewhat more decent one with epic blur effects](https://web.archive.org/web/20230326153840/https://thatoddshade.github.io/en/) (those are in at least one of every front-end developer's phases.);
2. what can currently be seen at [thatoddshade.is-a.dev](https://thatoddshade.is-a.dev) is built from some [Markdown](https://commonmark.org), [Sass](https://sass-lang.com) and HTML with [Zola](https://www.getzola.org);

I have more than one web identity, *thatoddshade* being the one I use on [this website](#website) and [other places](/links).

### nationalities

*no, „French“ is not a swear word!*

![European](/images/blinkies/nationalities/european.png "I am European.")
![French](/images/blinkies/nationalities/french.png "I am French.")

### languages

- *mi ken toki lon toki pona!*\

![French is my native language.](/images/blinkies/languages/french.png "French is my native language.")
![English is not my native language.](/images/blinkies/languages/english_second_language.png "because of my huge exposure to the web and about half of it being in that language, I have a decent level of English.")

### aesthetics

*I totally have an objectively good taste!*

![webcore](/images/blinkies/aesthetics/webcore.png "I like webcore.")

![right-handed](/images/blinkies/righthanded.png "I am right-handed.")
