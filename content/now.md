Lately, I have been doing a lot of poetry.

This month, I have been trying to do Inktober, but only have managed to do it sparsely.

I am reading : Hugo Rifkind’s <cite>Rabbits</cite>; Cormac McCarthy’s <cite>The Passenger</cite>; an Oxford Poets copy of D. J. Enright’s <cite>Paradise Illustrated</cite> and <cite>A Faust Book</cite>; and many other books.

<dfn>‘Now’ pages</dfn> are a kind of page that was imagined by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs). A list of these pages may be found at [nownownow.com](https://nownownow.com).
