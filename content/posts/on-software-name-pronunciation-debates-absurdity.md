software name pronounciation debates should have more actual linguistic knowledge involved.

<i>in this article, the verbs "to <i>appreciate</i>" and its negative form, "to not <i>appreciate</i>", are used to communicate respectively, in terms of aesthetics, the beauty and ugliness which I perceive.</i>

searching „gnu pronunciation“ on a search engine made me find, among the top results, a page on the official GNU website, [<cite>How To Pronounce GNU</cite>](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/pronunciation.en.html), telling about the way to pronounce „GNU“ that is intended by the people of gnu.org.

> The name &ldquo;GNU&rdquo; is a recursive acronym for &ldquo;GNU's Not 
Unix!&rdquo;; it is pronounced as one syllable with a hard <i>g</i>, like
&ldquo;grew&rdquo; but with the letter <i>n</i> instead of
<i>r</i>.

I do not <i>appreciate</i> the use of <q>hard <i>g</i></q> instead of "voiced velar plosive" or just <abbr title="the international phonetic alphabet">IPA</abbr>; however, I <i>appreciate</i> the use of an example word, <q>grew</q>.

doing the same with MySQL, top results include [a Stack Exchange question](http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/7231/ddg#7234), [a learnsql.com blog post](https://learnsql.com/blog/sql-or-sequel/), [another Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53624890/how-to-literally-read-the-word-mysql) and [a YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9T7DV8kWTw).

among these pages, those which allow comments/replies seem to often have one in which:
- someone cites a source recommending/imposing a pronunciation;
- someone says that the recommended/imposed pronunciation is bad and that theirs is better; or
- someone shares a nuanced opinion, saying that there is a <i>good</i>/<i>correct</i> pronunciation but that most people use another one and that it is fine.
