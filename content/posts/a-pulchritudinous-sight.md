these clouds! they are numerous, but in this amount, they cannot cover the blue above. \
this blue! it is bold, but it does not make the eye look away from the trees. \
these trees! on them are many colours; among them, each one is different. what entertainment for the eye! \
my eyes! so excited by this pulchritudinous sight.

see how sweet all of this is! \
ah, too bad! I will not always be here to see this; I must leave! \
ah, what a shame! my ability to look at the pictures will end; I shall die! \
how unfortunate! this will change: wind flies, sun turns, leaves fall, and rocks are scratched and scraped by all things flowing.

will this morph into beauty? \
will this morph into nastiness? \
no one can know!
