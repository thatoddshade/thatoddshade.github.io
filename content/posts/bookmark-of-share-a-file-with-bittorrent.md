this zine introduces to BitTorrent with
[Transmission](https://transmissionbt.com/) as a client. \
it teaches how to download and how to upload.

I highly recommend it to anyone who would like to get into BitTorrent but has
absolutely no clue on how to get started.

testing downloading can be quickly done with any torrent that has a high
number of active seeders, one of which being that of GIMP[^gimp-torrent].
