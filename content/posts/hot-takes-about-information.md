- people should stop caring about spelling and pronunciation, unless they are attempting to follow a style guide to reduce ambiguity (descriptivism is better than prescriptivism unless the latter has a functional purpose and is limited to a restrained set of contexts.);
- people should stop caring about the news (one should read facts that cannot die or that tell about the past rather, than today's utterances about today.);
- people should think for themselves (how much of that which one thinks is from actual continuous reflexionâ¸®); and
- people should avoid relying on their first guess (abduction is the least relyable inference.).

all of these are or have been among my own sins.
