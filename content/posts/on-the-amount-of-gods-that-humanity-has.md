Religion has progressed, historically, from:

- there is a very large quantity of widely dispersed gods and you don't know about the vast majority of them
- there are quite a few gods, but a bounded amount
- there is exactly one god
- there are exactly zero gods

By extrapolation, we can conclude that the next step is that humanity has negative one god, i.e. is in theological debt and must build a god to continue. This is where the EY-style "aligned singleton" came from. But people are now moving toward "we need everyone to have pocket gods" because they are insane, in line with the pattern. The next step is of course "we need to build gods and put them in everything"."""
