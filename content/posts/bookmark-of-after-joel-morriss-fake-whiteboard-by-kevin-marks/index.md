After Joel Morris's fake whiteboard being taken as real on here, how about we post our own (real) odd whiteboard diagrams that made sense at the time. Here's one of mine from 2008.

{{ photo(src="whiteboard.png", alt='3 rectangular boxes with circles connected by arrows inside. The left one is labelled "mework" , the centre "public net", the right "personal" arrows labelled "me" connect them right to left.
Oval blob outside labelled attacker points into public labelled me, with a reverse arrow saying "notme".
Another oval blob labelled "fake Steve Jobs" has an arrow pointing to the "LinkedIn" circle in mework.
Above is a URL path
/lookup?q=A|&fme=1|&sgn=1
On the left there is a list

so, this would basically make me able to say that someone who claims is me but is not actually me is not me?

like this?

```html
this pal says they're me but that's a lie: <a rel="notme" href="https://liarswebsite.com/">Liar</a>.
```
