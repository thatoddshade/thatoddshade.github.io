> I wish you to be miserable

<!-- more -->

in a bathhouse, Hatred comes, as anyone would, and sits next to a bather in the hot water.

Hatred:
> hello, please listen to my words.

the bather:
> wha- who are… what?

Hatred:
> eudaemonia, eudaemonia, eudaemonia, eudaemonia…\

the bather:
> huh?

Hatred:
> …is a Greek concept for happiness or welfare.\
eudaemonisn is believing that happiness is the primary goal of life.\
but I don't want you to be happy. I wish you to be miserable.\

the bather:
> what do you mean…? are you okay…?

Hatred:
> happy people are not those who change things. unhappy people are.\
I, and my siblings Anger and Sadness… our family is the only one that actually
matter.\
when you lousily scream and loudly cry, people… they try to <i>fix</i> you,
without even wondering about what you actually want.\
the depths of your emotions are like a forbidden garden.
I want you to explore it:\
emotions aren't wrong; emotions aren't evil.\
please leave those who try doing that to you; I know they're not attempting to
but they hurt you more than your mental state does.\
please live away from Comfort and Security; the two of them are just
manipulative bitches.\
Predictableness and Convenience won't help
you either: they are control freaks; that's it.\
ask my good friend Struggle for fuel; it's always nice to have them around.\
drive away from the Happiness family; they're just psychos.\
turn the suffering into something.\
something which isn't inherited,\
which is yours,\
which does not seek to be loved,\
of which you can be proud.\
embrace your pain.

Hatred sits back up from the water and starts walking away.

the bather:
> er… goodbye…?

Hatred, <i>stopping but not turning around</i>:
> eat a good fish. water your little tulips.
