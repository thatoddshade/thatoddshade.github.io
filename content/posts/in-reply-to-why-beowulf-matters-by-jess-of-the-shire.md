I have never studied <cite>Beowulf</cite> at school because French schools only teach about works written in Modern French as translation always adds some layer of interpretation and I do not unfortunately know anyone who has even ever heard of its name. I personally know it for my interest for fantasy, the Middle Ages, mythology and Germanic culture and languages; I believe I first read about it on Wikipedia when I was hyperfixated on Old and Middle English.
