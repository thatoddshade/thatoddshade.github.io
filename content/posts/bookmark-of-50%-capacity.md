I relate to this piece. I sometimes feel like my mind is absent / somewhere
else. \

this is sometimes due to missing an experience that I wish to have again: \
<!-- more --> I think about something that has happened.

this is sometimes due to anxiety: \
I think about something that is going to happen.

this is sometimes due to depression: \
I think about the value of everything that has happened \
and everything that is going to happen.
