I have a Zettelkasten[^1]. \
in its `§2025-01-08 14:04` entry, I have written the following:

>society's specialisation, \
programming[^2]'s [separation of concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns) \
linguistic [isolativeness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolating_language)[^3], \
and personal knowledge management's atomiticity[^4] \
are different concepts regarding one thing: \
having each member of a system \
have the smallest possible quantity \
of functions so that it can be \
as reused as possible. [^5]

<!-- more -->

when I started writing this article, I only wanted it to be a retranscription of this physical note, but I later started wanting to put links to Wikipedia articles about some of the mentioned concepts.
while doing so, I saw that the article [Separation of concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns) is in [the „Reductionism“ category](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Reductionism). \
with its main article, [Reductionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductionism), I realised that all of the concepts I listed in that Zettel can somewhat fit into reductionism.

[^1]: basically a box, or, for me, *two* boxes since not long ago, of Zettel (notes), which I personally hand-cut from old notebooks and sheets of paper to be roughly A6-sized, used with [the Zettelkasten method](https://zettelkasten.de)

[^2]: or, more broadly, computer science

[^3]: I actually meant „isolatingness“; I often accidentally say „isolative language“ instead of „isolating language“ for some reason.

[^4]:
 - for some reason, I could not find a dedicated Wikipedia article on this, even when searching the more common term, „atomic notes“.
 - I first read about in Andy Matuschak's note [Evergreen notes should be atomic](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zNUaiGAXp21eorsER1Jm9yU).
 - it is based on atomic design, introduced by Brad Frost in their blog post [„atomic design“ at bradfrost.com](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/), on which they are writing a book, [Atomic Design](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/).

[^5]: I would also add political [separation of powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_powers), which is part of what makes a democracry.
