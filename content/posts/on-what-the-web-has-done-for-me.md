## on defining humanity

> humans are a single species. \
> I have always been told I am a human, \
> yet I don't feel like one: \
> everything I see/hear/perceive and believe is a human feels different from me.
> 
> if I *am* a human, then \
> why can't I *talk* like one? why can't I *think* like one? why can't I
*behave* like one?
> 
> maybe I am right; maybe I am actually *not a human*, \
> but should I tell others? would that not sound silly?
> 
> are there different categories of humans? am I in a rare one? if I am, then why
> don't others appreciate me for my rarity, my uniqueness?
> 
> or is there actually *no* category? is humanity just a set of spectrums? \
> then should there not be more variety? or is this some kind of modal curve or
> something? is there a specific spot on the curve on which most humans are but
> not others like me?

this is a rendition in prose of a thought process I have had more than once.

the definition of humanity is an interesting topic: Romans defined themselves as descendants of gods and defined barbarians as animal-like beings (the word "barbarian" etymologically refers to people who speak like birdsong.); in the Middle Ages' Europe, humans were defined as sinners supposed to perform religious practices to be forgiven by God and thus be able to go to Heaven; during the Renaissance, humanists defined humans as creatures of knowledge (this might be the origin of the term "<i lang="lat">homo sapiens</i>"); later views seem to focus on the working aspect of life and <i>earning one's life</i>; and, today, humans are defined as <i>social animals</i>.

however, I do not think of my ascendance as divine, I hate God (if gods are real, either they are all dead or they are numerous and I do not know all of them.), most humans are dumb, I don't like work and I am probably an introvert or something.

another definition is humans as the only animals capable of art but I know a lot of non-artists who claim themselves to be humans ~~and are worse at painting than a cow~~ and a lot of artists who say that they are *not* humans.

those non-humans, I met them on the web.

## on the non-human <i lang="lat">sapiens</i>

> what do you mean, you're not human? like, you're on the web: you must've turned on
> a computer, made an account and posted shit, like words and pictures; you're
> doing stuff that *only humans* can do!

of that essence must be questions to non-humans on the web. if they are able to
do these things, there must be something that they and humans share and it may
have something to do with the humanist definition, knowledge, that which the
<i lang="lat">sapiens</i> holds.
