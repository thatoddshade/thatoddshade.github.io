- descriptivism is better than prescriptivism unless the latter has a functional purpose and is limited to a restrained set of contexts:
	- people should stop caring about spelling unless there is a reason to do so.
- undying facts are more valuable than ephemeral ones:
	- people should stop caring about the news.
- a lot of thoughts that one claims to have come from others:
	- people should *think for themselves*.
- abduction is the least relyable inference:
	- people should avoid assuming; and
	- people should not believe in their first guess.

- people should stop following random guidelines made by strangers on the internet.
