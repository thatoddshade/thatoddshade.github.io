I first authenticated with `thatoddshade.is-a.dev`, which got turned into `http://thatoddshade.is-a.dev/` by indieauth.com.
I can authenticate with either `thatoddshade.is-a.dev` or `http://thatoddshade.is-a.dev/`.

when authenticating with `https://thatoddshade.is-a.dev`, the channels are not the same, as if I were logged in with a different website.
when authenticating with `https://thatoddshade.is-a.dev` from a reader, an error occurs. Monocle shows this as the Microsub endpoint's response:

`http://thatoddshade.is-a.dev/` and `https://thatoddshade.is-a.dev/` seem to share the same token but are each considered as a different user.

this seems to be related to [#116](https://github.com/aaronpk/Aperture/issues/116) and [#52](https://github.com/aaronpk/Aperture/issues/52).
