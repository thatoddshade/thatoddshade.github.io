title = "on making the most rare from the most common"
+++

lately, I have been using that of which I have the most to make that of which I
have the fewest: \
I learnt two paper-folding techniques, one to make boxes and the other to make
envelopes, which I used as containers in which to put notes, task lists and
drawings;
as I have *a lot* of paper but very few containers (not space, *containers*),
this has been very useful to put aside numerous things that I wish to keep but
need to set aside / temporarily discard in favour of more at the time relevant
ones.

I remember having learnt about a way to organise task lists:

<pre>
|:::::::::::::|not urgent:::::::::::::::::|urgent:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::|
|not important|discardable / reschedulable|to be done second / potentially automatable|
|::::important|health, habits and routine |to be done first                           |
</pre>

I especially appreciate this understanding of <dfn>urgency</dfn>, being that some things that are urgent do not necessarily need focus.
however, something that I do not appreciate is that importance is not clearer, if not less, and that the different levels of urgency
are not taken into account.
