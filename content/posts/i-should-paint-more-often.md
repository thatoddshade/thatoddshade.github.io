I should paint more often.

this is a gouache painting. \
the wolf-like character in the middle is ~basically stolen from~ inspired by
Hundun from the <cite>You Shou Yan</cite> manhua (specifically chapter 261). the
bird-like ones around are completely unrelated; they are somewhat inspired by
Julia Soboleva's paintings.

also, white paint can apparently expire.
