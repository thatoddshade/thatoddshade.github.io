I should paint more often.

this is a gouache painting. \
the wolf-like character in the middle is ~~stolen from~~ inspired by
Hundun from the

the bird-like ones around are completely unrelated; they are somewhat inspired by
Julia Soboleva's paintings.

[^1]: {% cite() %}<ruby>有兽焉<rp>(</rp><rt>yǒu shòu yān</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>{% end %}, also called „Fabulous Beasts“ or „There be beasts“, can be read on [its MangaDex page](https://mangadex.org/title/151bca3e-db98-4ad2-8d8d-239943b91437/you-shou-yan); the chapter which inspired me is chapter 261, of which I read funkyy's translation to English.
