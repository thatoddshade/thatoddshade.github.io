a lot of the products shown on Apple's website's homepage are accompanied with a few adjectives; for example, the iPhone 14 has been described with "Big and bigger", the iPhone 14 Pro has got "Pro. Beyond."

and the iPad has got "Lovable. Drawable. Magical."

but is this accurate? <!-- more -->

these taglines all share a something: "Big and bigger", "Beyond" and "Magical" all imply a sense of ununderstandability, unreachability and *mystery*, as if Apple were selling more than shrunk down pieces of computer hardware stuck together under a some shiny plastic or metal.

this is different from the time when the GameBoy Color had a transparent shell to let people see the inside, when desktop computers had at least a dozen of ports, when *buying* and *owning* music, movies, video games and software was *actually possible*.

back then, technological products and media were not disguised ever-enshittifying subscription-based services. \
back then, things were small if they looked small. \
back then, things were big   if they looked big.   \
back then, things could touched, without a company monitoring every gesture.
back then, things did not need taglines to be *Lovable. Drawable. Magical.*
back then, things did not need to be *Magical* to be *Drawable*, they just had to be *huggable*.

## reappreciating that which is lovable {#lovable}

postcards.

I had never sent one. I had never received one. \

on the XXXX-XX-XX, I discovered riso.me. \
I *loved it*. I loved the dithering that is present on most images. I loved the colours. I loved the shapes. I loved the content. \
**clay things**? I have touched and interacted with clay! I remember having gathered some from a river and making a face out of it, twice! \
**microformats**? I have implemented and interacted with microformats! I wrote the <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> into the template files and installed an web browser addon to see them!

on the contact page, there was a mention of postcards, which used to not interest me, and of a website of which I had never heard, <cite style="text-transform: uppercase">Postcrossing</cite>. I read what X wrote about it, which expressed the excitement that they feel every time they reveive postcards sent by strangers, and soon became inspired to try this website.

the XXXX-XX-XX is when I first dared click on "Send", which provide me with and someone's profile on the website, their physical address and some links to various pages withe instructions and tips. I did not find any postcards at home (there actually were *a lot* of them; I just did not look in the right place) so I took some paper cardboard, cut it in what happens to be my favourite format ever, A6 (105mm by 148mm or roughly 4 by 6 inches), carefully care fully used a pen of my favourite kind, a black ink rollerball, and a ruler to trace a vertical line in the centre to clearly separate the text content on the left side from the recipient's address on the right side and made some collage on the back.

that collage was composed of a a picture of a river near which I live that I had taken with my smartphone and that I printed with a printer, accompanied by some cut out pencil drawings.

as the recipient lives in another country, I could not used green stamps, which can only be used from mainland France to somewhere else in mainland France. I had to used purple stamps, which cost slightly more (2.10<abbr title="euros">EUR</abbr>). \
as I feared that the whole <abbr title="dot it yourself">DIY</abbr> postcard could be somehow more than 20g, over which more than one stamp is required, I began the process of weighting it.

posting the postcard was a long process. the nearest postbox is more than one kilometre from where I live.
