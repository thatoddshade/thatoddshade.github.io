une interprétation purement  
objective n'est qu'une paraphrase:   
tout changement de ce qui est   
interprété est un ajout de per-  
sonnalité et donc un rapproche-  
ment du subjectif.

I don't care about the truth; if lies are prettier, I'll listen to them. \
**romanticism** has been the *de facto* in art for a while for a reason. however, today, any kind of evasion is precious.

I just wish not caring about politics was not looked down upon.

**why** I should care is what I do not know.
