„creatio ex nihilo“ is a Latin phrase meaning „creation from/out of nothing“  and often used to refer to the belief that matter can come from nothing.

to that is opposed „creatio ex materia“, meaning „creation from/out of matter“, which is often used to refer to the belief that all matter comes from some other matter, everything being neither lost nor gained.

today's science is in favour of the latter belief.

I believe that the same applies to creativity: creativity/creation from oneself, which could be named „creatio ex se“, cannot exist; ideas, just like matter, cannot be *ex nihilo*.
