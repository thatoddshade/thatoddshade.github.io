I have once again failed at managing my time; now, I am in a rush to accomplish what I could easily have done during those time spent by mindlessly scrolling.

I hate myself. my self-hatred is too much recurrent.	<!-- more -->

my scrolling addiction can manifest itself on anything but it is mostly on YouTube and reddit.

I have recently uninstalled YouTube; I hope it will help.
