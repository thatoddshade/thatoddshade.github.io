title = "„hello, world.“"

it was thirty two minutes after a midnight when I started typing this line;
17% remain in my laptop's battery.

this page's title is referencing a sentence commonly used in software
programming as a test for displaying text; if I remember correctly, the
exact original phrasing for it is „Hello, World!“.

I often find capital letters useless (my minimal usage of them is inspired by
[toki pona](https://tokipona.org)'s) and I rarely feel enthusiastic enough to
consider an exclamation point to be appropriate so it is „hello, world.“ for
me.
