searching „gnu pronounciation“ on a search engine may make one find, among the top results, a page on the official GNU website, [*How To Pronounce GNU*](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/pronunciation.en.html), about, as the name implies, the „right“ way to pronounce „GNU“.

now, do the same with MySQL; top results include [a stackexchange question](http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/7231/ddg#7234), [a learnsql.com blog post](https://learnsql.com/blog/sql-or-sequel/), [a stackoverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53624890/how-to-literally-read-the-word-mysql), [a YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9T7DV8kWTw) and much more.

do not feel forced to click on each on these links, it is definitely not worth it: it always follows the following pattern:
- someone cites the „official“ pronounciation.
- someone else says theirs.
- folks disagree.

and there always seem to be pseudo-IPA or comparisons to other English words instead of the sounds' name or any notation (I say „notation“ because even if the international phonetic alphabet is probably ideal, anything is better than a made-on-the-spot system).
