in the past, whenever one would want to be able to do *something new* with
their machine, they would have to get the software to do it.	<!-- more -->

now, with all of the pre-installed/featureful software that there is, they
either have to seek in that which they already have or, more likely, are
**too whelmed to even want to do something new**.

software went from an additive model to a substractive one:

<div style="margin-inline-start: 2ch;">

„get what you want“ \
got replaced by \
„get rid of what you don't want“.

</div>

this is noticeable through all of the
{% abbr(title="operating system") %}OS{% end %} unbloaters and the minimalistic alternatives to mainstream solutions.
