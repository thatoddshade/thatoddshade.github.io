these two are webcomics.

I discovered <a class="h-cite" href="https://strangereons.com/"><cite>STRANGER EONS</cite></a> through johnvertisement. \
I think someone (whom I know physically) talked to me about it… I am not sure but I feel some <i lang="fr">déjà vu</i> with the idea of online friends who live in different time periods.

the way by which I discovered <a class="h-cite" href="https://laikascomet.the-comic.org/"><cite>laika's comet</cite></a> is a bit more complicated. \
its creator, fourleafisland, is someone I first discovered through a YouTube recommendation of one of his art tutorial videos. \
I recently spotted someone with a profile picture that reminded him of his art style among the notes on a <cite>deltarune</cite>-related post reblogged by okayxairen… and it turned out to be actually him.	<!-- more -->	\
this is when I discovered <cite>laika's comet</cite>, as there were mentions of it on his profile.

<cite>laika's comet</cite> has a character named „Mars“; it also has a transgender character. \
<cite>STRANGER EONS</cite> has a character that is both named „Mars“ and transgender… and his pre-transition name is „Venus“. I just love this: Mars is a Roman god of war[^on-mars-as-a-god-of-war] and Venus is a Roman goddess of beauty; the eponymous planets' astrological symbols, „♂“ and „♀“, are used to represent males and females in biology.[^the-wikipedia-article-for-planetary-symbols]

I can't stop finding coincidences in things about which I learn roughly at the same time… \

[^on-mars-as-a-god-of-war]: Mars is not *the* god of war; he is the god of *physical* war; there is another deity related to war, Athena, who is closer to the *strategy* and *tactics* aspect of it, alongside wisdom and knowledge.
