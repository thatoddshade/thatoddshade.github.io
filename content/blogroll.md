<h2>this page is <em>not</em> up to date.</h2>

<p>it currently lists only two different websites, which <em>does not</em> reflect the number of people I actually know/admire: I am subscribed to many YouTube channels, follow many Fediverse accounts and have many RSS feeds registered in my reader. I just need to somehow make Microsub  work to bring all of that into a single spot; once this is done, I will <em>finally</em> and <em>accurately</em> update this page.</p>
